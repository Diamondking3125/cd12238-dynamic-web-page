# Project introduction

I have made a dynamic web-page that has an active element with multi section and a working comment section.

## Table of Contents
- [HTML file](#html-file)
- [CSS file](#css-file)
- [JS file](#js-file)
- [Note](#note)

## HTML file

I have edited the html to add 2 sections(total: 5) and a comments form I decided to put it inside a section to have the active style and I chose to link the JS file before the body's closing tag.

## CSS file

I modifed the CSS file so that the comments have a style matching the page's style and added some styles to the nav-bar.

## JS file

I have called all the elements I needed and stored them into variables with meaningful names, also I bulit the nav-bar dynamicly using appendChild and createElement functions, added a smooth scrolling method, an active state, an area where the user's submitted comments are and stored them into localStorage so that they don't disapear on refresh.


### Note
I wanted to ask a question. What's the difference between the smooth scrolling with JS and the smooth scrolling with CSS? Which is better and more efficent? and Why?
